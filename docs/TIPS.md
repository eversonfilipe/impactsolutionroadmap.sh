## Project Vision

`ImpactSolutionRoadmap.sh` was born from a simple but powerful idea: the world's most innovative strategic tools should be in the hands of those solving its most critical problems. It is a non-commercial, open-source project driven by the philosophy that technology can and should be a democratizing force for positive change.

Our goal is to build a platform that is:

-   **Accessible:** Completely free, forever. No subscriptions, no hidden costs.
-   **Powerful:** Providing capabilities that rival expensive enterprise software.
-   **Private:** Built on a serverless architecture that respects your data sovereignty.
-   **Collaborative:** Developed in the open, with and for the global impact community.

## About the Initiator

The project was conceptualized and initiated by **Everson Filipe**, a professional passionate about the intersection of technology, agile methodologies, and social impact. He believes in leveraging modern tools to create scalable, sustainable solutions for ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) challenges.
