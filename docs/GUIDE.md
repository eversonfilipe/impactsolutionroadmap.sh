# ImpactSolutionRoadmap.sh - User Guide

Welcome! This guide will walk you through the features of `ImpactSolutionRoadmap.sh` to help you create powerful and actionable blueprints for your impact projects.

## Step 1: Define Your Goal

The first step is to tell the AI what you want to achieve. This is done in the **"Your Roadmap Goal"** text area. A good prompt is clear, specific, and provides enough detail for the AI to understand the scope of your project.

-   **Bad Prompt:** "Make a roadmap for water."
-   **Good Prompt:** "Create a detailed blueprint for a community-led water purification and distribution system in a rural, semi-arid village. The solution should be low-cost, sustainable, and use locally sourced materials where possible. Include phases for community engagement, technology selection, implementation, and long-term maintenance."

## Step 2: Add Context (Optional but Recommended)

If you have existing research, project documents, or specific data, you can upload them in the **"Add Context"** section. The AI will use the content of these files to create a more tailored and informed roadmap.

-   Click the upload area or drag and drop your files.
-   Supported formats: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.html`.
-   This is perfect for providing case studies, technical specifications, or stakeholder analyses.

## Step 3: Generate the Blueprint

Once you're ready, click the **"Generate Blueprint"** button.

You will see the AI's response being streamed in real-time in a code box. This shows you the raw JSON structure being created. Don't worry about the formatâ€”the application will parse and display it beautifully once the generation is complete.

## Step 4: Interact with Your Roadmap

After the AI finishes, your roadmap will be displayed. Here's what you can do:

-   **Track Progress:**
    -   A **progress bar** at the top shows the overall completion percentage.
    -   Click the **check circle icon** next to each node's title to mark it as complete. The node will become faded, and the progress bar will update.

-   **Save Your Work:**
    -   Click the **"Save"** button to add the current roadmap to your History.
    -   Once saved, any progress you make (toggling node completions) will be automatically saved to that version.

-   **Download as Markdown:**
    -   Click the **download icon** to save your entire roadmap as a `.md` file. This is great for sharing, version control, or importing into other tools like Notion or Obsidian.

-   **Review Sources:**
    -   The "Sources" section lists the web pages the AI used to ground its information, providing a starting point for your own research.

## Step 5: Manage Your History

Click the **"History"** button in the header to open the history panel. Here you can:

-   **View Saved Roadmaps:** See a list of all the blueprints you've saved.
-   **Load a Previous Version:** Click on any roadmap in the list to load it as your active roadmap.
-   **Delete a Roadmap:** Click the trash can icon to permanently remove a roadmap from your history.
