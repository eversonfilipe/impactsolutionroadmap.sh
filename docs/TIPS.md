## Prompt Engineering for Better Results

The quality of your generated roadmap is directly related to the quality of your prompt. Here are some tips to get the best possible results from the AI.

1.  **Be Specific and Clear**: Instead of "roadmap for education," try "Create a 3-phase roadmap to implement a solar-powered e-learning platform for 50 remote primary schools in Northern Kenya."

2.  **Define the Persona and Tone**: You can instruct the AI on how to behave. For example, start your prompt with: "Act as a senior project manager for a UN development program. Your tone should be formal and strategic."

3.  **Request a Structure**: Ask for specific phases or sections. Example: "The roadmap must include four main stages: 1. Needs Assessment, 2. Pilot Program, 3. Full-Scale Rollout, 4. Impact Measurement."

4.  **Provide High-Quality Context**: Uploading a well-researched document, even a short one, can dramatically improve the output. A document containing key statistics, stakeholder names, or specific challenges will ground the AI's response in reality.

5.  **Iterate**: Your first generated roadmap is a draft. Use it to refine your prompt. You might notice the AI missed a key area, so you can add it to your next prompt: "Generate the previous roadmap, but also include a detailed section on fundraising and grant applications."
