## 1. Roadmap Generator

This module allows you to create comprehensive roadmaps from a simple idea.

### Step 1: Define Your Goal

The first step is to tell the AI what you want to achieve. This is done in the **"Your Roadmap Goal"** text area. A good prompt is clear, specific, and provides enough detail for the AI to understand the scope of your project.

-   **Bad Prompt:** "Make a roadmap for water."
-   **Good Prompt:** "Create a detailed blueprint for a community-led water purification and distribution system in a rural, semi-arid village. The solution should be low-cost, sustainable, and use locally sourced materials where possible. Include phases for community engagement, technology selection, implementation, and long-term maintenance."

### Step 2: Add Context (Optional but Recommended)

If you have existing research, project documents, or specific data, you can upload them in the **"Add Context"** section. The AI will use the content of these files to create a more tailored and informed roadmap.

-   Click the upload area or drag and drop your files.
-   Supported formats: `.txt`, `.md`, `.json`, `.html`, `.pdf`.
-   This is perfect for providing case studies, technical specifications, or stakeholder analyses.

### Step 3: Generate and Interact with Your Roadmap

Click **"Generate Blueprint"** and watch the AI build your plan. Once complete, you can:

-   **Track Progress:** Click the check circle icon on each node to mark it as complete.
-   **Save Your Work:** Click the **"Save"** button to add the roadmap to your History. Progress updates are saved automatically.
-   **Download as Markdown:** Click the download icon to save your roadmap as a `.md` file.

## 2. Analytics Hub

This hub provides AI-driven tools to estimate and report on your project's ESG impact.

1.  **Describe Your Project**: In the text area, provide a clear description of your project or organization's activities. Include details like size, location, and key operations.
2.  **Generate Report**: Click **"Generate ESG Analysis"**.
3.  **Review Your Dashboard**: The AI will generate a dashboard with:
    -   An **estimated carbon footprint** (Scopes 1, 2, and 3).
    -   An **overall ESG score** with a breakdown of Environmental, Social, and Governance factors.
    -   A list of **suggested KPIs** relevant to your project.
    -   A **draft ESG report** in Markdown format.

This provides a powerful starting point for your impact measurement and reporting efforts.

## 3. Knowledge Base

Leverage the AI as an ESG expert to answer your questions and generate roadmap templates.

-   **Ask a Question**: Type any question about ESG frameworks (like GRI, SASB), methodologies, or best practices into the input box and click **"Ask"**. The AI will provide a detailed, referenced answer using its web search capabilities.
-   **Generate Templates**: Use the second form to request a specific type of roadmap (e.g., "A roadmap for a circular economy startup in the fashion industry"). The generated roadmap will appear in the main "Roadmap Generator" tab, ready for you to customize and save.

2.  **Provide Context**: Briefly describe your organization and its operations.
3.  **Generate Compliance Pack**: Click the button to have the AI generate a customized compliance package, which includes:
    -   A detailed, step-by-step **compliance checklist**.
    -   A **draft of a key compliance document** relevant to the selected regulation.
